We store our images in S3 at three different sizes: 400px per side,
800px, and full resolution.

This tool manages those image objects, mainly by ensuring proper access
control to the full sized images that are [outside Public
Domain](https://collections.artsmia.org/search/-rights_type:%22Public%20Domain%22).
